# Work Day Scheduler

## Use Cases

First you can click on any time block and edit text to write down what you have to do in that hour.

You can hit the blue button on the right of the hours to save your changes.

Current time is listed up top and blocks change colors based upon whether the hours have passed, are current, or are upcoming. 

## Future Edits

I plan on making it a 24 hour calender.
I can make it based on different time zones.
